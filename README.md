# Impact of this feature
The impact of adding this feature will be huge, as we’ve now reduced the gap between our customers and the actual product. More and more people would be eager to try the product and ultimately increase the sales by a very large factor.
# How does it work?
We will be using SceneViewer by triggering a explicit intent to it. Scene Viewer is an immersive viewer that enables 3D and AR experiences from our Android app. It lets users of our application easily preview, place, view, and interact with web-hosted 3D models in their environment. It uses ARCore, which is Google’s platform for building augmented reality experiences. Using different APIs, ARCore enables our application to sense its environment, understand the world and interact with information.

ARCore uses three key capabilities to integrate virtual content with the real world as seen through your phone's camera:

1.**Motion tracking** allows the phone to understand and track its position relative to the world.

2.**Environmental understanding** allows the phone to detect the size and location of all type of surfaces: horizontal, vertical and angled surfaces like the ground, a coffee table or walls.

3.**Light estimation** allows the phone to estimate the environment's current lighting conditions.
